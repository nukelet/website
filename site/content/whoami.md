## About me

I'm Vinicius, a 22-year-old Computer Engineering student from Brazil.

I enjoy tinkering with computers and making them break in funny ways.
My main interests in CS are operating systems, computer architectures
(particularly RISC-V), parallel computing and computer graphics.
I'm currently getting my feet wet with contributing to the Linux kernel.

Other than that, I'm a huge fan of Linguistics, particularly
[typology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_typology). Language
learning has been one of my favorite activities for a long time, and I'm
currently ~~struggling with~~ learning Mandarin Chinese. I'm also an avid
music listener and enjoy dabbling in bass and brazilian guitar in my
free time.
