      <title>My first kernel patch: fixing a broken bluetooth dongle</title>

      <description>TL;DR I bought a cheap Bluetooth USB dongle from AliExpress, and really wanted to use it, but it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t connect to any devices on Linux. I was looking to get started with contributing to the kernel and decided to tackle this problem and potentially send my first patch.&#xA;The issue was that the controller erroneously reported support for the Read Encryption Key Size HCI command; when the kernel tried to follow the standard and run it during the key exchange that happens when connecting to BT devices, the controller would bail out and the connection would fail.</description>
